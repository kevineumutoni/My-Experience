     I came to AkiraChix on 31<sup>st</sup> January 2025, and after arriving here at school, the staff were so amazing and welcoming, I was happy to hear <a href="https://ke.linkedin.com/in/linda-kamau-a5288125" target="_blank">
        Linda Kamau </a> (Founder and Executive Director at AkiraChix) calling my full names on the first day, I was like wow she is so happy to have me, and am also happy to be here &#129395;,  I used to dream being in an environment that empowers and supports tech women and that's what AkiraChix does, the alumni told me that AkiraChix is a best place for personal growth, and I was very motivated.
    I was so excited to eat meat every day both lunch and dinner, the way chefs do their magic and give us yummy food is so amazing, Our bed looks neat and same, It is so great to be a student at Akirachix, <br> I love how am so comfortable being in school, they show us their trust in us and it pushes me to work at my very best.
    <br> I was so excited to be in a diverse place for the first time because I was having fun and shocked hearing about the following things mentioned below from my collegues; <br> </p>
